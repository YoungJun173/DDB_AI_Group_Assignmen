The stage, by Nicolas Winding Refn. Violence and abuse, the victims left in a state of prolonged mental suffering, failure of institutions in understanding adolescent deviant behavior, violent arm of the law and to end the dreams of omnipotence megalomica. This is Bronson, the film of Nicholas Winding Refn / director Tom Hardy and very good player in the role of Michael Peterson aka Charles Bronson /. That is a true story of Bronson. The convict thug, convict the most dangerous of England, has attracted public attention for his want artistic and literary production but also for their way of life accompanied by a personal code of honor. It is not a murderess, will not beat women or children. What is the strategy to tell Refn Bronson? The stage. Bronson is the protagonist on stage, as it is in many prisons turned from him. At that stage in those costumes and tells the general public. Ironically, the isolation becomes a friend and as such provides the necessary time to draft the script as the text of self-narration. Remember the scene with the convict in double face? This is Bronson, I understand, a man in extraordinary performance by Tom Hardy is presented to us a little jester but also very, very corrosive. Council to see the film, directed by brilliant quality, the history is not easy to tell and interpret it for the music, but ... Keep a safe distance. Good Click! ITALIAN VERSION Il palco, di Nicolas Winding Refn. Violenza e sopraffazione; vittime lasciate in prolungato stato di sofferenza psichica, incapacit delle istituzioni nel comprendere comportamenti adolescenziali devianti, braccio violento della legge e per finire sogni di onnipotenza megalomica. Questo Bronson, il film di Nicholas Winding Refn regista / e Tom Hardy bravissimo protagonista, nel ruolo di Michael Peterson in arte Charles Bronson /. Quella di Bronson una storia vera. Il galeotto picchiatore, il galeotto pi pericoloso d Inghilterra; ha attirato su di s l attenzione pubblica vuoi per la sua produzione artistico-letteraria ma anche per il proprio stile di vita accompagnato da un personalissimo codice d onore. Infatti, non un assassino, non picchia le donne n i bambini. Qual la strategia di Refn per raccontarci di Bronson? Il palco. Sul palco Bronson protagonista assoluto, cos come lo nelle tantissime carceri da lui girate. Sul quel palco ed in quei costumi si racconta al grande pubblico. Per assurdo, l isolamento gli diventa amico e come tale fornisce il tempo necessario per la stesura del copione quale testo autonarrativo. Ricordate la scena con il galeotto in double face? Questo Bronson, mi par di capire; un uomo che nella straordinaria interpretazione di Tom Hardy ci presentato un po giullare ma anche tanto, tanto corrosivo. Consiglio di vedere il film, per la regia qualitativamente brillante, per la storia non facile da raccontare ed interpretare; per le musiche; ma... tenetevi a debita distanza. Good Click! '",

As you can tell, I am not a fan of his. The cinematography is gorgeous, sure, but the film is entirely off-putting and never really hooks you in. Tom Hardy is phenomenal here, but ultimately, the film itself is too shallow and self-indulgent to really do anything important. Charles Bronson is a riveting person and though he may not be worthy of having a film made about him, he certainly makes for an interesting character study. Sadly, the film is so short and so focused on how violent we can make it, it never really conducts this study and you are just left saying, wow he s pretty violent, eh? If this is the intent, then good job on the success, but it does not make this one an interesting biographical film in the least. Yet again, Nicolas Winding Refn sacrifices substance for style and yet again, it blows up in his face. The style is gorgeous, again, but without Hardy s fantastic embodiment of Bronson, this one would be far worse. '",

And perhaps you will, but you will also be glad that he is still behind bars. The film opens with a man on stage proclaiming, My name is Charlie Bronson, and all my life I ve wanted to be famous. The auditorium appears to be empty, but later, a still unseen audience provides the approval he so desperately covets.\\r\\rBorn Michael Peterson (Tom Hardy), in a British suburb in 1952, he first went to prison at the age of 22 for burglarizing a post office. He stole 26.18 and received seven years for the crime, but that sentence was quickly extended as Peterson s infractions inside began to pile up: insubordination, violence, blackmail, and multiple hostage situations. Michael is gradually swallowed up by the prison system, seemingly an environment that suits him best. It is during this time that Michael Petersen, the boy, fades, and Charles Bronson, his superstar alter ego, takes over. Bronson occupies any territory in which he exists by sheer, brute, force. Bronson s first and only instinct is to fight, to capture, and to win. He never makes it to phase two of planning. He has now spent more than three decades in jail, with the majority of those years in solitary confinement, and has become a tabloid sensation as the most violent prisoner in Britain.\\r\\rThe film is impressively structured and edited, shot in dark tones--illustrating his theme that Bronson is an artist looking for a canvas, whose search is frequently violent, crazy, and erratic. The director is Nicolas Winding Refn, most famous for the movie Drive (2011), and his Pusher trilogy of films about Copenhagen s violent, multi-ethnic underworld. Refn himself is something of a rebel, who brings a sharp, surreal, foreign eye to the film.\\r\\rThe film solely rests upon the astonishing performance from an almost unrecognizable Tom Hardy. Bronson never asks for our sympathy for his situation, but somehow, at times, he is able to do just that. Hardy brings a raw physicality to the role, leaping naked about his cell, jumping from tables, and hurling himself into half a dozen guards. Unfortunately, the film never gets under the skin of Bronson and his motivations. It omits other facets of his life including the Muslim woman he married in jail, his conversion to Islam, and the subsequent renouncement of the awards he won for his art and poetry.\\r\\rEnduring the egotistical ramblings of a psychopath may not sound like a particularly entertaining prospect, but Bronson delivers on all fronts. Gripping, visceral, ugly, and beautiful, Bronson is quite brilliant. '",

This fact is even more surprising giving asThis film is so British that I want to send it to Prince Charles as anger release material to the fact that his mother is still alive and kicking. And good for her, God Bless The Queen, indeed. This fact is even more surprising giving as Nicolas Winding Refn, the directorial mind behind this exhibition piece is Danish.Aesthetically, this is strapped of any beauty. It is a raw, intentionally unpolished piece into the life of Britain s most notorious prisoner, Michael Peterson a.k.a. Charles Bronson. Saying that Tom Hardy shines performing this maniac would be a poor choice of words. His performance is beyond good or bad, its simply performance art--which is what I think Charles Bronson is. He is the ultimate performance artist. You can clearly see Hardy enjoying playing him because his versatile talent is pushed to theatrical lengths.Refn did not bother going into details about Bronson s life or upbringing, but he wanted us to know that he did not have any traumas as a child. He strips any reasoning for this film and wants us to understand that Charles Bronson is like that simply because he IS like that. You can t pin me down--he says. For him, prison was opportunity, his violent outbursts were an art form. The scene in which he captures the librarian bringing him books to incite the guards just so he can do his routine shows that perfectly, not to mention the theatrical intermissions which are also a big clue.For the inevitable brawl with the guards he prepares like any artist does for a performance. In his case, he strips naked, paints his body and is eager to rumble. Bronson revels in chaos and beyond that there really is not much going on. The interactions with people around him are sparse, linear and the outside world simply does not work for him.There really is not much to say about this film. Its all about Bronson and the guards topping each other off over and over again. Refn constantly smashes his head against a concrete wall here, and while its engaging to watch at first, after a while you become irritated, even disturbed by it. '",

Although our psychopathic protagonist narrates some of his own stories to the audience, he doesn t give any sort of an explanation to his deranged behavior and acts of violence., thus Refn assures us that the aim of his movie is not to provide us with the titular lunatic criminal s clear motives or even causes; but rather to tell us that humans can act in a most barbarous way with no reason, or at least with a reason we can t grasp at all.Nicolas Winding Refn explored Bronson s baffling psyche through art, many sorts of art one of them is Tom Hardy s monumental acting abilities and tremendous range. I ve always been a fan of this massively talented and charismatic British actor, and this is undisputedly one of his finest performances in his career, so far.Sadly, I was never constantly invested in the movie. Honestly, the movie almost lost me completely after the first 25-30 minutes. Nevertheless, I found some moments to be highly entertaining and quite engaging; but that was only sporadically. I think Refn could have explored, or rather made us explore, Bronson in more aspects and with more creativity, which Refn, apparently, has no shortage of. Instead, 95% of Refn s artistry is at the very beginning and very the end. The remaining 5% could have been gone unnoticed if it wasn t for Hardy s mind-blowing performance.(6.5/10) '",

I have met many women in my lifetime, and I am pretty sure that each and every one of them would be creeped out to the max by a character as depicted by Malkovich. None would even remotely think of even touching this weirdo. There is absolutely zero chemistry between him and the student, why would she sleep with him ? And why would she turn on him ? She seems utterly disgusted by him right from the start, which is quite understandable, yet she starts a relationship with him. I think I have seldom seen such bad acting in a movie before, the dialogue is just not real, you can tell the lines are rehearsed.

It s a worthy corrective to mendacious film fantasies like Forrest Gump. Those born since the 70s have no idea of how threatened, paranoid and alienating it was in post-WWII America, and the propaganda ministry of the mainstream media tends to keep it that way. With regards to Ochs, the film exaggerates his interest in pop-stardom, which was always an absurdist parody of same. Likewise the influence of John Wayne. James Dean was a real influence, particularly the misunderstood rebel without a cause who died an early tragic death. Likewise, the diagnosis of bipolarity, which is made much of, seems mainly in retrospect. Today bipolarity is a catch-all for what were in those days psychopathologies, and the victims of which were often institutionalized. Today many of the delusional symptoms of same are treatable with drugs. In those days they were not. But, distinctly, that s not what was wrong with Ochs. He was saner and more politically astute than most. Under the stresses of the music business, radical politics, harassment by the FBI, he took various drugs and drank in excess, and they took their toll. There is a form of depression that results from chronic THC intake, and it s known to sometimes lead to suicide. That may have been it with Ochs, if indeed he committed suicide.... But I digress. The film is worth seeing. Phil Ochs lives. '",

Puss joins Humptey Dumptey and Kitty Softpaws to find the magic beans from the evil Jack and Jill and they must work each other as a team to get the golden eggs at the top of the clouds more like from the fairy tale of Jack and the Beanstalk. Next, we meet the characters from the movie. Antonio Banderas returns the voice as Puss in Boots, Salma Hayek voice as Kitty Softpaws, Zack Galifianakis voice as Humptey Alexander Dumptey, and of course Jack & Jill was voice by Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris. Those characters are fun to watch and they did pretty well such as Banderas and Hayek since they team up in Desperado. Most importantly, the animation was wonderful and I saw this movie once again in 3D.

I like the fact that it doesn t rely with the Shrek movies. What I mean is that you don t have to see any Shrek movie to understand this film. The creators had done a terrific job developing the character Puss in boots s (his origins, etc). All the other characters were great. Every actor s voice matched perfectly with their character. Of course, we all know Antonio Banderas (as Puss in Boots), but even Zach Galifianakis (as Humpty Dumpty) and Salma Hayek (as Kitty Softpaws) did a wonderful job. The comic moments were cleaver, and they all had the perfect timing (essential in comedy). It also has that Mexican style, with the songs and all that. It funny for me, because in this movie (including Shrek) they make fun of fairy tales. So the creators put all type of stereotypes and representation for each fairy tale character (like Puss in boots is Spanish). This movie didn t lose that sort of humor . A thing that I founded interesting was, in some scenes, they splited the screens, to show different places at the same time. They made fun of that, which was cool. In general, it s enjoyable movie, worth a watch. '",
